Hi,

I compiled and linked my program with gcc to produce an executable named album
using the line in the command prompt:
	
	gcc photos.c -o album

Depending on your compiler you will need to change the statement.

Run the executable from the directory it is in by using the statement below in 
the command prompt:

	album
	
When running the executable, the program will prompt the user for an album id.

After recieving the album id, the program will check that it is valid, and 
then procede to print the photo id and title for each photo associated with that
album to the command prompt.

NOTE: All photo album data is stored in a file named photodata.txt and it is
			essential to the program that this file exists within the same directory
			as the executable.

Thank you for giving me an opportunity to show my technical skills, and I look
forward to hearing from LT soon.
